            <h3>Skills Demonstrated</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Front-end development with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.</li>
                <li>Designing data models for users, artworks, locations, and events.</li>
                <li>Consuming REST APIs and handling asynchronous data loading.</li>
                <li>Building responsive layouts and clear navigation for end-users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Working on GeoGrafik showed me how many small decisions are involved in building a full-stack
                application. I had to think not only about how to fetch and display data, but also how users
                would actually move through the site and discover artworks and events. Designing the entities
                for artwork, location, and event helped me understand how important data modeling is for
                keeping a project maintainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project strengthened my practical skills in React, TypeScript, and REST APIs, and it also
                highlighted employability skills such as communication and adaptability. I frequently adjusted
                the UI based on feedback from instructors and classmates, which felt similar to responding to
                stakeholder feedback in a real workplace. In future projects, I plan to extend this app with
                features like user authentication and map-based search so I can continue improving my skills in
                full-stack development and user experience design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I collaborated closely with my partner <strong>Riley</strong>. Since we were not using GitHub or
                Bitbucket, we communicated clearly and coordinate our work manually. This experience improved
                my teamwork, planning, and problem-solving skills. It also showed me how important version control 
                can be in larger projects, and it encouraged me to adopt Git-based workflows in future development.

                <li>Building a single-page front-end using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.</li>
                <li>Connecting the UI to a <strong>FastAPI</strong> back-end written in <strong>Python</strong>.</li>
                <li>Designing and implementing reusable form components with validation for agencies, applicants, and grants.</li>
                <li>Thinking about data relationships and how changes to one record affect related records.</li>
                <li>Collaborating in a team using <strong>Bitbucket</strong>, branches, and pull requests.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This project helped me experience what it is like to work on a full-stack application with a clear
                separation between front-end and back-end. On the front-end, using React and TypeScript made me think
                carefully about component structure and data types. On the back-end, FastAPI and Python showed me how
                to design clean REST endpoints that the UI can depend on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working in a team also strengthened my employability skills. We used Bitbucket for version control, which
                meant creating branches, opening pull requests, and reviewing each other's changes before merging. This
                taught me how to communicate design decisions, give constructive feedback, and keep our codebase
                consistent. In future projects, I want to continue building on this experience by adding more automated
                tests and documentation to make collaboration even smoother.

                 class="project-img">
            
            <h3>Skills Demonstrated</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with <strong>SQLite</strong> to store task data locally on the device.</li>
                <li>Implementing scheduled reminders using <strong>AlarmManager</strong> and <strong>BroadcastReceiver</strong>.</li>
                <li>Integrating the device camera to attach completion photos.</li>
                <li>Using <strong>LocationManager</strong> to record where tasks are completed.</li>
                <li>Designing a simple, user-friendly interface for everyday personal task tracking.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                TaskTracker was a great opportunity for me to build an app that can be used by anyone, not just workers or 
                technicians but also students and everyday users who want a better way to organize their tasks. I learned
                how different Android components work together, including local storage, camera integration, and scheduled
                notifications.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One of the biggest lessons was managing runtime permissions and handling edge cases, such as what happens
                when a user denies location or camera access. This helped me understand how to build reliable mobile apps
                that respond gracefully to user choices. Going forward, I want to expand TaskTracker with cloud syncing
                and user accounts so tasks can be accessed across multiple devices.
