            <h1 class="section-heading">About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a <span class="highlight">Computer Systems Technology student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic</span>
                in Saskatoon, SK. Along with full-stack development in React and mobile development in Android,
                I also have experience from coursework using <span class="highlight">Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#</span>
                to build interactive applications, data-processing utilities, and web projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before starting CST, I completed my Automotive Service Technician program and worked in
                fast-paced environments at Ens Toyota and DSI Underground. That experience taught me how
                to troubleshoot problems methodically, communicate clearly with customers, and stay calm
                under pressure, skills I now apply to software development and technical support.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my recent projects, I have worked with <span class="highlight">React, TypeScript, FastAPI, 
                Python, Node.js, SQLite, and Android (Kotlin/Java)</span>. I enjoy building reliable, user-friendly tools,
                such as a public art mapping app, an internal grant application system, and a TaskTracker Android 
                app for anyone who wants to stay organized.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My short-term goal is to begin my career in an <span class="highlight">IT support or junior developer</span>
                role where I can combine hands-on troubleshooting with software development. Long-term, I
                want to specialize in <span class="highlight">building tools that make technical workflows easier</span>,
                whether that’s for internal teams or public-facing applications.

                    <p>
                        Created an Android app that lets users add tasks, schedule reminder notifications, attach a photo when a task is
                        completed, and optionally log where it was completed. The goal is to make everyday task tracking simple and
                        practical for students, workers, or anyone who wants better organization.
